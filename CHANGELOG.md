## 1.7.1
- Auctionator-style tabs: **Shopping**, **Selling**, **Cancelling** and **VoidMark** on the Auction House tab row (replacing 1.7.0's single tab). Each trading tab opens its own screen with no section buttons; sub-screens such as Buy Item show a **< Back** button.
- The **VoidMark** tab holds Scanning, History, Vendor, Crafting, Settings and Tools, and reopens the last one used.
- With Auctionator also loaded, the trading tabs read **VM Shopping**, **VM Selling** and **VM Cancelling** so the two sets are distinguishable.

## 1.7.0
- Auction House: one **VoidMark** tab replaces the five separate tabs that crowded or clipped the tab row (worst with Auctionator). The tab reopens the last section you used.
- Market navigation: Shopping, Selling, Canceling, Scanning, History, Vendor, Crafting, Settings, Tools.
- Drag any empty part of the Auction House (native tabs included) to move the whole window. Position and scale are saved and restored each time the AH opens; MoveAny keeps control when it is installed. Settings > Reset Window resets the AH layout while docked.
- The docked Market layout re-fits when the AH is resized or rescaled, so controls are not clipped.
- Tooltips: compact per-unit price, stack total for hovered bag stacks, CURRENT vs STALE label with source and age, and a "No AH price yet" line for auctionable items without data (bind-on-pickup and quest items stay silent).
- Bank-to-main catch-up: trusted prices older than the 2-hour freshness window (for example, scanned before pairing) are now offered to the partner, labelled by age, and never replace a newer observation. Existing journals re-seed once after updating.
- Sync no longer stalls permanently on a revision too large for one addon message; throttled sends retry after 1.5 s instead of 4 s.
- Removed leftover button names (SNIPER, BANKER, REVALIDATE, FULL SCAN) from help text. Verified no Safe Mode code or text remains.
- Tests run on stock Lua 5.1 without lupa. 149 regressions.

## 1.6.0
- Replaced twelve main tabs with Shopping, Selling, Canceling, Vendor Deals, Crafting, and Tools.
- Added item-name search with Enter, saved-list sidebar, readable price columns, and contextual empty states.
- Moved detailed scan reports into Diagnostics; simplified scan and connection status.
- Fixed sharing across spaced/normalized names for the same realm and faction.
- Included fractional per-unit stack prices in the shared price feed, rounded up to integer copper.
- Announced scan metadata after publication completes; sped up acknowledged price sharing.
- Reconnect now reseeds locally available prices without resetting financial records.

## 1.5.8 - Automatic account sync dashboard
- Add SYNC tab, automatic named pairing, automatic eligible bank-character AH scans,
  reconnect/full replay, peer scan metadata, persisted completion diagnostics.
- Refresh Browse after incoming price pages; show observation timestamps in Browse
  details and tooltips, with explicit synced/stale labels.
- Preserve saved data, throttled resumable deltas, trade gates, and offline backoff.
- Add pairing/off persistence, automatic scan guards, and sync dashboard regressions.

## 1.5.0 — Forever Live

Remove Safe Mode. Add confirmed manual shopping, posting and cancellation, named shopping lists, passive variant-specific price tooltips, and incremental paired-account sharing. Retain schema 1, account-local finances, old clipboard imports, crafting and the existing intelligence dashboards.
